# 🧠 One Man Agency

> *A personal lab for small, meaningful digital experiments — designed, built, and narrated by one person.*

Welcome to **One Man Agency** — a space where I explore the intersection of creativity, technology, and emotion through small, purpose-driven digital projects.

Each project begins as a thought experiment and evolves into a tangible artifact — a website, a visual, or a system — something that exists in the world.

### 🚀 Live Projects

### 📜 Philosophy

> “You don’t owe the world your attention span, but you can still sense its pulse.”

The **One Man Agency** exists to build things that make people *pause*, not scroll.  
Every project is a refusal of noise and a small celebration of clarity.

Read more about the [creative principles](./docs/philosophy.md).

### 🪞 Backstory

One Man Agency was born from a simple question:  
> “What if one person could build a studio of ideas — not clients?”

It’s a personal creative ecosystem — each project a quiet rebellion against complexity, attention capture, and creative paralysis.

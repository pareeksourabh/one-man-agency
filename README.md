# ü§ñ One Man Agency

> *Exploring how far one person, empowered by AI and modern tools, can think, design, and build at the scale of an entire creative agency.*

### üß≠ What This Is

**One Man Agency** is an ongoing experiment in creative and technical autonomy.

It asks a simple question:  
> ‚ÄúWhat happens when one person uses today‚Äôs technology stack ‚Äî AI, automation, design systems, and modern code ‚Äî to operate like a full agency?‚Äù

Every project in this space is built end-to-end by a single individual, using accessible, mostly free tools, and a mix of human design instinct and AI acceleration.

Some projects will be functional.  
Some will be poetic.  
Some may even be absurd.  
Each exists to explore **what‚Äôs possible when curiosity meets capability.**

### üöÄ Current Experiments

| Project | Description | Live |
|----------|--------------|------|
| [Today in Emojis](https://pareeksourabh.github.io/today-in-emojis/) | A micro-news experiment that captures the world‚Äôs daily pulse in five emojis. | ‚úÖ |
| [Today in Visuals](./docs/02-today-in-visuals.md) | A visual evolution ‚Äî single-panel art that reflects the world‚Äôs emotional weather. | üß© Concept Stage |

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Each project follows a similar lifecycle:
1. **Ideate** ‚Äî define a problem or curiosity worth exploring  
2. **Design** ‚Äî create minimal interfaces that communicate emotion or insight  
3. **Build** ‚Äî implement using modern frameworks and AI tools  
4. **Automate** ‚Äî enable self-sustaining systems (data, content, or outreach)  
5. **Reflect** ‚Äî document outcomes and learning  

The process repeats ‚Äî small, contained, intentional.

### üí° Areas of Exploration

- AI-assisted creativity and automation  
- Solo engineering productivity  
- Micro-branding and digital storytelling  
- Visual simplicity and emotional communication  
- Experimentation as a learning model

### üß† Personal Bias

I‚Äôm most energized by projects that blend **art, simplicity, and experimentation.**  
If something has a hint of social or cultural meaning, that‚Äôs a bonus ‚Äî but the core driver is **building elegantly, quickly, and with intent.**

### üìú Philosophy

> ‚ÄúOne person. Many small worlds.‚Äù  
>  
> Each project is proof that focus, curiosity, and modern technology can achieve what once required teams.  

See the [Philosophy](./docs/philosophy.md) page for the creative principles that guide these experiments.

# 🌍 Today in Emojis

> *A zero-cognitive-load daily pulse of the world — five emojis, one feeling.*

---

### 🧭 Purpose

**Today in Emojis** began as an experiment to counter the fatigue of constant information.  
The idea: help people sense the mood of the world *without* demanding their attention span.

It’s not about headlines.  
It’s about **emotional resonance** — awareness without overload.

### 🧩 The Experience

Each day’s page presents:
- **Five emojis** representing global sentiment  
- No scroll, no clutter — just feeling, at a glance  
- A footer that invites subtle interaction (❤️ 🤔 👎)  
- A single link — *“What’s this?”* — for those curious enough to read the backstory

> You don’t owe the world your attention span.  
> But you can still sense its pulse.
